When run, use commands -shc -usa
(gives stochastic tour of the usa)
prints out tour
then using that tour, give it as params to Plot
prints out GUI that has tour

Utilization of Stochastic Hill Climbing: taught me how randomization is a powerful tool within AI to "stumble" across different answers
Attempt to solve problem with linear optimization(failed), demonstrates another approach to the solution that is guaranteed to find the shortest path (optimal path is contained in the enclosed region of the vectors representing the distances between each capital)
Also contains Nearest Neighbors
Overall, lots of fun
Maybe I do the tour in real life?
