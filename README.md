Utilization of Stochastic Hill Climbing: taught me how randomization is a powerful tool within AI to "stumble" across different answers
Attempt to solve problem with linear optimization(failed), demonstrates another approach to the solution that is guaranteed to find the shortest path (optimal path is contained in the enclosed region of the vectors representing the distances between each capital)
Overall, lots of fun
Maybe I do the tour in real life?
